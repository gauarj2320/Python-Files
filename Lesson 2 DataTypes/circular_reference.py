# Here is the **memory table representation** for your **circular reference example**:



# Explanation of Circular Reference:



"""

## **ðŸ”¹ Memory Table Before Circular Reference**
| Variable | Object (Value) | Memory Address | Reference Count |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| `a`      | `[1, 2]`      | `0xAAA`       | **1** |
| `b`      | `[3, 4]`      | `0xBBB`       | **1** |

- `a` points to `[1, 2]` with **1 reference**.
- `b` points to `[3, 4]` with **1 reference**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Memory Table After Circular Reference**
| Variable | Object (Value) | Memory Address | Reference Count |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| `a`      | `[1, 2, â†’0xBBB]`  | `0xAAA`  | **2** (One from `a`, one from `b`) |
| `b`      | `[3, 4, â†’0xAAA]`  | `0xBBB`  | **2** (One from `b`, one from `a`) |

- `a` now contains **a reference to `b`** (`â†’0xBBB`).
- `b` now contains **a reference to `a`** (`â†’0xAAA`).
- **Both objects now have 2 references!** (One from their variable, one from each other)

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Memory Table After `del a` and `del b`**
| Variable | Object (Value) | Memory Address | Reference Count |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| `[1, 2, â†’0xBBB]`  | `[1, 2, â†’0xBBB]` | `0xAAA` | **1** (Only from `b`) |
| `[3, 4, â†’0xAAA]`  | `[3, 4, â†’0xAAA]` | `0xBBB` | **1** (Only from `a`) |

- Even though `a` and `b` are deleted, their **objects still exist** in memory because they **point to each other**.
- **Their reference counts never reach 0**, so they are **not freed immediately**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ How Does Garbage Collector Handle This?**
1. **Python detects the circular reference** (objects refer to each other).
2. **If there are no outside references**, the garbage collector **removes both**.
3. **If `gc.collect()` is called manually**, Python **forcibly clears the cycle**.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Solution: Breaking Circular Reference**
```python
a[-1] = None  # Break reference inside list
b[-1] = None  # Break reference inside list

import gc
gc.collect()  # Now memory is freed
```

ðŸš€ **Now, `gc.collect()` successfully removes the circular reference!**
